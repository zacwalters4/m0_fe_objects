# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

Nothing really

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

I honestly have not been taking many notes, instead I am referencing past challenges and tasks if ever necessary

- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

Generally, I only google something if I need a specific function I don't know, or if I know/feel there is a function that can simplify my code and make things more concise and easy. Otherwise, I tend to try and find a solution based on what current knowledge I already have.
